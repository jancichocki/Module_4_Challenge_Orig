# Financial Portfolio Performance Analysis

## Introduction
This project conducts a thorough analysis of financial portfolios including major investment firms and algorithmic trading strategies against the S&P 500 index. Using Python for data manipulation and analysis, the project evaluates the performance of these portfolios to determine which strategy outperforms the market.

## Data Sources
- **Whale Returns**: Represents the returns of major investment firms.
- **Algorithmic Trading Strategies**: Returns generated from algorithmic trading within the market.
- **S&P 500 Index**: Used as the market benchmark for comparison.

All data is processed and analyzed to extract insights into the comparative performance of each strategy.

## Objectives
- Calculate and compare daily and cumulative returns of all portfolios to the S&P 500.
- Analyze the volatility of the portfolios.
- Determine the risk of each portfolio.
- Calculate and interpret the Sharpe Ratios.
- Conduct rolling statistics analyses to understand the trends over time.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
2. **Performance Analysis**:
    - Calculate daily returns.
    - Calculate cumulative returns.
3. **Risk Analysis**:
    - Calculate the standard deviation.
    - Plot box plots for each portfolio.
4. **Rolling Statistics**:
    - Calculate and plot rolling standard deviation.
    - Calculate and plot the correlation.
    - Calculate and plot Beta for a chosen portfolio.
5. **Sharpe Ratios**:
    - Calculate and visualize the Sharpe Ratios.

## Conclusions
The analysis provides insights into which portfolios outperform the S&P 500 index and offer a higher return per unit of risk. Detailed findings will be discussed based on the calculated metrics.
